# blog-site
Creating a more backend focused project serving dynamic html and creating APIs for a content editor using CRUD Operations.
## What is it 
A Blog site where I can share my thoughts and opinions about Computer Systems, Web Development also creating tutorials and reviews on my favorite books. but for now I will populate the blog site from my markdown application [Vimnotes](https://github.com/Sty6x/markdown-app)w just to see how it looks.
## Reason
I wanted to explore more into the backend side of things by building a multi-page application, the pages that are served to the clients are dynamic and is updated through an API that I can attach to a content editor that could use CRUD operations, and I was also curious how I could implement a JWT authentication strategy to secure my API.   

I might populate this project with meaningful contents to share with other people, but as of now I am currently busy.
