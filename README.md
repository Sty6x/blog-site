# blog-site
Creating a more backend focused project serving dynamic html and creating APIs for a content editor using CRUD Operations.
## What is it 
A Blog site that contains _(for the mean time)_ my placeholder contents from my markdown application [vimnotes](vimnotes.vercel.app).
## Reason
I wanted to explore more into the backend side of things by building a multi-page application, the pages that are served to the clients are dynamic and is updated through an API that I can attach to a content editor that could use CRUD operations, and I was also curious how I could implement a JWT authentication strategy to secure my API.   

I might populate this project with meaningful contents to share with other people, but as of now I am currently busy.

## How to run

`$ cd /blog-site`  
> To install dependencies.

`$ npm i`   
`$ npm run dev`
